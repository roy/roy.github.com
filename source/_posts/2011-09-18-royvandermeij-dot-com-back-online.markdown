So it has been a while, but I'm back. 
I was thinking of creating a new blog site from scratch, but then I found out about [octopress](http://octopress.org). I quickly decided it was time to get my hands dirty and setup this new site.

## What you'll find here?
Mostly tech posts about rails, sproutcore, setup configurations etc.

## Will you find it interesting?
I certainly hope so? Otherwise this site will just be a list of reminders for me to do some awesome stuff :)

Hope to see you here around, and Iâ€™ll try not to let you down
